--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---
The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.

Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?

Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.

There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?

For example:

3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.

Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.

In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.
To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!

Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?"""

Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about helping some Elvish Senior Historians find their missing Chief
Historian by checking a list of historically significant locations. The problem is that they have two different
lists of location IDs, and they need to reconcile them.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. From the description, it seems like I have two lists of
numbers, and I need to pair up the smallest numbers from each list, then the next smallest, and so on, and
calculate the differences between these paired numbers. Finally, I have to sum up all these differences to get the
total distance between the two lists.

Let me break this down step by step.

Step 1: Read the input lists.

The input is given in a file named "input.txt". I need to read this file and extract the two lists of numbers.
From the example, it looks like the lists are presented side by side, separated by tabs or spaces.

For instance:

3   4

4   3

2   5

1   3

3   9

3   3

So, each line contains two numbers, one from each list.

Step 2: Parse the input.

I need to read the file, split each line into two numbers, and store them in two separate lists.

Step 3: Sort both lists.

According to the problem, I need to pair up the smallest numbers from each list, then the next smallest, and so
on. So, I should sort both lists in ascending order.

Step 4: Pair up the numbers and calculate the differences.

Once both lists are sorted, I can iterate through them simultaneously, calculate the absolute difference between
corresponding elements, and sum these differences to get the total distance.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

- The lists might have different lengths. Although in the example they are the same length, I need to consider if
one list is longer than the other.

- The lists might contain non-integer values, but based on the example, they seem to be integers.

- There might be negative numbers, but in the context of location IDs, it's unlikely, but I should still consider
it.

- Empty lists: although the problem states that the lists contain location IDs, I should consider if a list could
be empty.

Given that the problem mentions "location IDs," which are likely positive integers, but to be safe, I'll assume
they can be any integer.

Wait, in the example, there are numbers like 1,2,3,4,5,9, all positive integers, so my assumption seems correct.

Now, about reading the file:

I need to open "input.txt" and read its contents. I should handle any reading errors, like if the file doesn't
exist.

Let me think about how to structure the code.

First, I'll write a function to read the file and parse the lists.

Then, I'll sort both lists.

Finally, I'll calculate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

But wait, in the example, the pairs are:

1 (left) with 3 (right), difference 2

2 (left) with 3 (right), difference 1

3 (left) with 3 (right), difference 0

3 (left) with 4 (right), difference 1

3 (left) with 5 (right), difference 2

4 (left) with 9 (right), difference 5

Total sum: 2+1+0+1+2+5 = 11

This suggests that both lists have the same length, and they are paired element-wise after sorting.

But what if the lists have different lengths? In the problem statement, it says "pair up the numbers", implying
they have the same length. However, in the example, both lists have 6 elements, but I should confirm if this is
always the case.

Looking back at the problem description: "pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in
the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on."

This suggests that both lists are expected to have the same number of elements.

Therefore, in my code, I can assume that both lists have the same length.

But to make the code robust, perhaps I should add a check to ensure both lists have the same length, and handle
cases where they don't.

However, since this is an Advent of Code puzzle, and the input is controlled, I can probably safely assume that
both lists will have the same length.

Now, let's think about implementing this in code.

Step 1: Read the file and parse the lists.

I'll open "input.txt", read it line by line, and split each line into two integers, adding them to two separate
lists.

Step 2: Sort both lists.

Use the sorted() function on both lists.

Step 3: Calculate the sum of absolute differences.

Iterate through the sorted lists simultaneously, calculate the absolute difference between each pair, and sum them
up.

Let me write a sample code snippet in my mind.

left_list = []

right_list = []

with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:

for line in f:

a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())

left_list.append(a)

right_list.append(b)

left_sorted = sorted(left_list)

right_sorted = sorted(right_list)

total_distance = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted))

print(total_distance)

That seems straightforward.

But wait, in the problem description, it mentions "the first fifty places they'll look". Is this relevant?

Looking back, it says: "system\nYou are standing in a computational puzzle room. The room contains a terminal with
a prompt asking for input."

"instructions\nSolve the computational puzzle by writing a program that takes input from standard input and
outputs to standard output."

"Your program should read input from standard input and write output to standard output."

So, perhaps the input is provided via standard input, not necessarily from a file.

But in the example, it's given as a file "input.txt".

In Python, I can read from standard input using sys.stdin.

Let me adjust my code accordingly.

Import sys

left_list = []

right_list = []

for line in sys.stdin:

a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())

left_list.append(a)

right_list.append(b)

left_sorted = sorted(left_list)

right_sorted = sorted(right_list)

total_distance = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted))

print(total_distance)

This should work.

Let me test this with the example provided.

Example input:

3 4

4 3

2 5

1 3

3 9

3 3

After parsing:

left_list = [3,4,2,1,3,3]

right_list = [4,3,5,3,9,3]

Sorted:

left_sorted = [1,2,3,3,3,4]

right_sorted = [3,3,3,4,5,9]

Pairwise differences:

|1-3|=2

|2-3|=1

|3-3|=0

|3-4|=1

|3-5|=2

|4-9|=5

Total sum: 2+1+0+1+2+5=11

Which matches the example.

Seems correct.

Is there any other consideration?

Potential for large input sizes? The problem doesn't specify, but Advent of Code puzzles can sometimes have large
inputs, so I should ensure that the code is efficient enough.

Sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n), which should be fine for reasonable input sizes.

I'll assume that the input size is manageable.

Another thing to consider is whether the input contains non-integer values. According to the problem, they are
"location IDs," which are likely integers, so I'll proceed assuming they are integers.

Floats or other types aren't expected.

Now, to make this code executable, I need to write it into a Python script.

I can name the script "aoc_day1.py" or something similar.

But since Advent of Code puzzles are typically numbered by day, and this is an example, I'll just name it
"main.py".

Finally, to run the script, I can use:

python main.py < input.txt

This will redirect the contents of input.txt to standard input, which my program can read.

Alternatively, in some programming environments, the input is directly provided via standard input without needing
a file.

In any case, my code should work in both scenarios.

I think this should solve the puzzle.

## Final Solution
To solve this computational puzzle, we need to calculate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding
elements of two sorted lists of integers read from an input source. The input consists of pairs of integers, each
pair being two integers separated by spaces on separate lines. These integers represent "location IDs" and are to
be sorted and compared pairwise to find the total distance as per the puzzle's requirements.

### Approach

1. **Reading Input:** Read the input from standard input where each line contains two integers.
2. **Parsing Input:** Parse these lines to create two separate lists of integers.
3. **Sorting Lists:** Sort both lists in ascending order.
4. **Calculating Differences:** Compute the absolute difference between corresponding elements of the sorted lists
and sum these differences to get the total distance.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    left_list = []
    right_list = []

    for line in sys.stdin:
        a, b = map(int, line.strip().split())
        left_list.append(a)
        right_list.append(b)

    left_sorted = sorted(left_list)
    right_sorted = sorted(right_list)

    total_distance = sum(abs(a - b) for a, b in zip(left_sorted, right_sorted))
    print(total_distance)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:** The input is read from standard input using `sys.stdin`, which allows the program to handle
input dynamically.
2. **Parsing Input:** Each line from the input is split into two integers, which are then appended to two separate
lists: `left_list` and `right_list`.
3. **Sorting Lists:** Both lists are sorted using the `sorted()` function to ensure that the smallest elements
from each list are compared first, followed by the next smallest, and so on.
4. **Calculating Differences:** By zipping the two sorted lists together, we pair corresponding elements and
calculate the absolute difference for each pair. These differences are then summed up to get the total distance,
which is printed as the final output.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the
puzzle.
