Create code for the following problem. Read the input from file input.txt in the same directory as the code

Alright, so I've got this problem to solve. The task is to read from a file called "input.txt", parse through it
to find valid multiplication commands in the form of "mul(X,Y)", where X and Y are numbers, multiply those
numbers, and sum up all the results from these multiplications.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a valid "mul" command. From the description, it's "mul(X,Y)" where X
and Y are 1-3 digit numbers. Anything else is invalid and should be ignored. For example, "mul(4*, mul(6,9!,
?(12,34), or mul ( 2 , 4 )" are all invalid, while "mul(44,46)", "mul(123,4)", etc., are valid.

So, my approach should be to:

1. Read the content from "input.txt".

2. Find all occurrences of "mul(X,Y)" where X and Y are numbers between 1 and 999 (since they are 1-3 digit
numbers).

3. Ignore any invalid formats.

4. For each valid "mul(X,Y)", calculate X*Y.

5. Sum up all these products.

6. Output the total sum.

To achieve this, I'll need to use regular expressions to match the valid "mul" commands. The regex should look for
"mul(" followed by 1-3 digits, a comma, and then another 1-3 digits, and then ")". Something like
"mul(\d{1,3},\d{1,3})".

Once I have all the matches, I'll need to extract the numbers X and Y from each match, convert them to integers,
multiply them, and keep a running total of these products.

I should also consider edge cases, such as:

- Multiple "mul" commands in a row without any separating characters.

- Invalid characters immediately before or after a valid "mul" command.

- Leading zeros in the numbers (e.g., "mul(001,2)").

In Python, leading zeros in numeric literals are not allowed, but since the numbers are read as strings, "001"
should convert to 1 without issues.

Let me sketch a rough plan in code format:

- Open and read "input.txt".

- Use re.findall() with the appropriate regex to find all valid "mul(X,Y)" commands.

- For each match, extract X and Y, convert them to integers, multiply, and add to a sum variable.

- Print the total sum.

I need to make sure that the regex is precise enough to ignore invalid commands. For example, it should not match
"mul(4*" or "mul[3,7]" or "? (12,34)".

So, the regex should strictly look for "mul(" followed by 1-3 digits, then a comma, then another 1-3 digits, and
then ")". No extra characters should be allowed within the "mul" command.

In Python's re module, I can use a pattern like r'mul(\d{1,3},\d{1,3})' to match this.

But wait, this pattern will match "mul(1,2)" correctly, but it will include the parentheses in the match. I need
to capture the numbers inside, so perhaps using groups: r'mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)'.

This way, I can extract group 1 and group 2 as X and Y.

Let me test this pattern with some examples:

- "mul(44,46)" should match with X=44, Y=46.

- "mul(123,4)" should match with X=123, Y=4.

- "mul(001,2)" should match with X=1, Y=2.

- "mul(4*)" should not match.

- "mul[3,7]" should not match.

- "? (12,34)" should not match.

- "mul ( 2 , 4 )" should not match because of the spaces.

Good, this seems correct.

Now, I need to make sure that the entire "mul(X,Y)" is properly bounded. For example, in "mul(44,46)abc", the
regex should still match "mul(44,46)" even if there are characters following it.

But to ensure that I'm not matching parts of longer strings, I might want to use word boundaries or
lookaheads/lookbehinds to make sure that "mul(X,Y)" is a complete token.

Wait, perhaps using r'\bmul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)\b' could work, but I'm not sure if that's sufficient because
parentheses are not word characters.

Alternatively, I can use a more precise regex to ensure that what precedes and follows the "mul(X,Y)" is not part
of a larger token. Maybe using negative lookaheads and lookbehinds.

But for simplicity, perhaps relying on re.findall() to find all non-overlapping matches will suffice, assuming
that the input doesn't have overlapping valid commands.

I'll proceed with r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)' as the pattern.

In code, it would look like this:

import re

with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:

data = f.read()

pattern = r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)'

matches = re.findall(pattern, data)

total = 0

for match in matches:

# Extract X and Y from the match

x_str, y_str = re.search(r'mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)', match).groups()

x = int(x_str)

y = int(y_str)

product = x * y

total += product

print(total)

This seems straightforward. But I should test it with the example provided:

"xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))"

From this, the valid commands are:

- mul(2,4)

- mul(5,5)

- mul(11,8)

- mul(8,5)

Their products are:

- 2*4 = 8

- 5*5 = 25

- 11*8 = 88

- 8*5 = 40

Total sum: 8 + 25 + 88 + 40 = 161

Let me simulate the code with this input.

data = 'xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))'

pattern = r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)'

matches = re.findall(pattern, data)

# matches should be ['mul(2,4)', 'mul(5,5)', 'mul(11,8)', 'mul(8,5)']

total = 0

for match in matches:

x_str, y_str = re.search(r'mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)', match).groups()

x = int(x_str)

y = int(y_str)

product = x * y

total += product

print(total)  # Should print 161

Yes, this works as expected.

I need to make sure that there are no edge cases that could break this logic. For example:

- mul(0,0): Should be valid, with product 0.

- mul(999,999): Assuming that int can handle large numbers, which it can.

- mul(123,456): Valid.

- mul(1,2): Valid.

- mul(12,34): Valid.

- mul(123,45): Valid.

- mul(1,234): Valid.

- mul(12,345): Valid.

I should also consider if there are any leading zeros in the numbers, like mul(001,002). int() will correctly
convert '001' to 1.

Another thing to consider is if there are multiple "mul(X,Y)" in the same set of parentheses, but since we're
using non-overlapping matches, it should handle that correctly.

For example, "mul(1,2)mul(3,4)" should be two separate matches.

Also, if there are nested "mul" commands, like "mul(1,mul(2,3))", but according to the pattern, it shouldn't match
the inner "mul(2,3)", only the outer one. But since our pattern is strictly for "mul(X,Y)", where X and Y are
digits between 1 and 3 places, it should be fine.

I think this covers most of the cases.

Now, writing the final code:

import re

with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:

data = f.read()

pattern = r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)'

matches = re.findall(pattern, data)

total = 0

for match in matches:

x_str, y_str = re.search(r'mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)', match).groups()

x = int(x_str)

y = int(y_str)

product = x * y

total += product

print(total)

This should solve the problem correctly.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to parse a given text file for specific patterns that represent multiplication
commands and compute the total sum of their products. The multiplication commands are in the format "mul(X,Y)",
where X and Y are integers with up to three digits. We must ensure that only valid commands are considered and
ignore any invalid or partial patterns.

### Approach
1. **Read the Input Data:** Read the entire content from the input file.
2. **Pattern Matching:** Use regular expressions to identify all valid "mul(X,Y)" commands. A valid command must
have:
   - The string "mul("
   - Followed by up to three digits for X
   - A comma
   - Followed by up to three digits for Y
   - Closing parenthesis ")"
3. **Extract and Calculate:** For each matched pattern, extract the values of X and Y, convert them to integers,
multiply them, and sum up all these products.

### Solution Code

```python
import re

# Read the input data from file
with open('input.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Define the pattern for matching "mul(X,Y)"
pattern = r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)'

# Find all matches in the data
matches = re.findall(pattern, data)

# Initialize total sum
total = 0

# Process each match to extract X and Y, convert to integers, multiply, and add to total
for match in matches:
    # Extract X and Y from the match using another regular search
    x_str, y_str = re.search(r'mul\((\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})\)', match).groups()
    x = int(x_str)
    y = int(y_str)
    product = x * y
    total += product

# Output the total sum
print(total)
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading the Input:** The file 'input.txt' is read into a string variable `data`.
2. **Regular Expression Pattern:** The pattern `r'mul\(\d{1,3},\d{1,3}\)'` is designed to match the "mul(X,Y)" strings where X and Y are integers
with up to three digits.
3. **Finding All Matches:** `re.findall()` is used to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the input data.
4. **Extracting and Calculating Products:** For each matched string, another regular expression search extracts X and Y using capturing groups.
These strings are converted to integers, multiplied, and their product is added to a running total.
5. **Output the Result:** The total sum of all products is printed.

This approach ensures that only valid multiplication commands are considered, and it efficiently computes the required sum using regular
expressions for pattern matching.
